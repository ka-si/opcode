2. Implement cp command



#!/bin/bash
# check if source and destination file/directory are provided
if [ -z "$1" ] || [ -z "$2" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 source_file_or_directory destination_file_or_directory"
  exit 1
fi

# check if source file/directory exists
if [ ! -e "$1" ]; then
  echo "$1 does not exist."
  exit 1
fi

# check if source and destination are the same
if [ "$1" -ef "$2" ]; then
  echo "Source and destination are the same."
  exit 1
fi

# check if source is a directory
if [ -d "$1" ]; then
  # create destination directory if it doesn't exist
  if [ ! -d "$2" ]; then
    mkdir -p "$2"
  fi
  # copy all files and directories recursively
  cp -r "$1"/* "$2"
else
  # copy the file
  cp "$1" "$2"
fi

echo "File(s) copied successfully."





./cp.sh source_file_or_directory destination_file_or_directory




./cp.sh myfile.txt backup/myfile.txt
